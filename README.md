# parallel-computing-find-prime-numbers

Purpose
====
+ find the prime number betwee 0 ~ 10^10 with parallel computing

<br>
<br>part1 : find the prime number between 0~10^10 and skipping time and memory on searching multiple of 2
<br>part2 : improve from part1 and skip the MPI_browcast
<br>part3 : improve from part2 and add cahce reuse
